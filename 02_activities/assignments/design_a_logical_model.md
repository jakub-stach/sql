# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

--done see in the single ERD

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

--added both kinds of architectures in there and showed them as 1 or 2, pick one that works best.

type 1 is the one that holds a single level of information (i.e. gets overwritten), type 2 retains change

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
```
with type 1 we hold less data about the customer's history which can be considered obtrusive in some cases 

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://imgur.com/a/u0m8fX6)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
``` 
Your answer...
The AdventureWorks Schema is a lot more detailed, complex, and uses colours to separate different functional/conceptual areas of the DB. It also looks to have undergone some level of normalization, even in the case of sales, those are a lot more detailed with specific splits for things like taxes, currency, quotas, cc info and territories. 

If I had all the time in the world I would love to go through a project that designs and utilizes a db in a real world scenario. I've done some SIS mapping previously and it was quite challenging even for a small scale aspect of it so I imagine a large DB would take hours on hours of work.
